            <h2>Become a Web Developer</h2>
            <p>My First aim of 2022 is to learn and prepare myself to become a Front-End Web Developer of any IT firm.
                Since I have no previous knowledge, I am very excited to face this challenge. </p>

            <h2>Learn Time Management</h2>
            <p>One of the key things I want to learn is how to manage time. In the world full of multi-tuskers, I
                believe managing time is a must attribute to have.</p>

            <h1>Seek Help From Coummunity</h1>
            <p>It is okay to seek help. It is okay to feel down sometime. But If we keep things only to ourselves,
                situation will get worse. I have always felt awkard to ask for help from strangers which will eventually
                hamper my web development journey. But thankfully, I have got community named "Programming Hero" where
                people stay read to help out. I will use this opportunity to make my journey smoother.</p>
